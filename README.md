# Concordia schedule to Google calendar.

## Description

This is a web application that converts your University(Concordia) schedule to recurring Google calendar events, it uses the micro-framework [Flask][fl].
When you input the url of you schedule, you have the option to chose if you would like to create a secondary calendar.
This app also parses <http://www.concordia.ca/maps/sgw-campus.html> and <http://www.concordia.ca/maps/loyola-campus.html> to get each possible physical location on the two campus of Concordia.

## Installation

I suggest you to create a [virtualenv][ve] for this project.
Providing you have pip installed on your machine,
use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required modules.

## Configuration file

Make sure to modify appropriately [config.py](/config.py/), with the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET of the app you will create in the [the Google API console][gapi]. This application also needs to have the Google calendar scope to be able to operate.

## Running

```bash
    python run.py
```
will start a Flask server locally.
