# Concordia schedule to Google cal.

## Notice

This application is deprecated since Concordia changed its student user
interface to a close application. BOOOOH!!!

## Description

This is a web application that converts your University (Concordia) schedule to recurring Google calendar events, it uses the micro-framework [Flask][fl].
The app parses the academic schedule provided on the website of MyConcordia with the help of lxml using XPath.
It also parses <http://www.concordia.ca/maps/sgw-campus.html> and <http://www.concordia.ca/maps/loyola-campus.html> to get each possible physical location on the two campuses of Concordia.

## Installation

I strongly suggest you to create a [virtualenv][ve] for this project.
Then, providing you have pip installed on your machine,
use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required modules.

## Configuration file

Make sure to modify appropriately [config_example.py](/config_example.py), with the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET of the app you will create in the [the Google API console][gapi]. Then change the file name to *config.py*.


## Running

```bash
    python run.py
```
will start a Flask server locally. You can now go to http://localhost:5000/ to see the website.
